Introduction
This project focuses on reconstructing input images from deep network features (feature inversion) using modern generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models. The main goal is to understand and visualize what information deep networks (e.g., ResNet-101) retain at various representation levels. By performing feature inversion, we find the difference between high-level deep features and human-understandable image space. 
We also explore hybrid approaches that combine the structured latent space of GANs with the generative flexibility of diffusion models. The final objective is to reconstruct images with high fidelity while preserving consistency. Applications include model interpretability, data privacy evaluation, and understanding the representational capacity of deep networks.

Dataset Description
For this project, we use the ImageNet dataset (ILSVRC 2012) as the primary source of images. ImageNet contains over 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 object categories.
We also consider using CIFAR-10 (60,000 32×32 color images in 10 classes) for rapid experimentation and preliminary evaluations.
For diffusion-based inversion fine-tuning and GAN inversion testing, we may sample subsets of CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets, which contain high-quality human face images commonly used for generative modeling research.

Dataset Summary:
ImageNet: Large-scale object classification dataset, 1.2M images, 1,000 classes.
CIFAR-10: Small-scale, 60K images, used for prototyping.
CelebA-HQ / FFHQ: High-resolution face datasets used for GAN/Diffusion model inversion tests.
