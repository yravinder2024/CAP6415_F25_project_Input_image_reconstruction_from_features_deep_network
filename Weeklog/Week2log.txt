WEEK 2 LOG

We implemented the feature extraction pipeline for cifar-10 from a pretrained ResNet-101 model. This step is essential for preparing the dataset of feature maps and original images 
that will be used later for training the GAN-based and diffusion-based reconstruction models. 

-> Created Dataset Loader for Raw Images
  Loaded raw images via a standard PyTorch DataLoader.
  Applied necessary preprocessing transformations:
  1.	Resize
  2.	Normalize
  3.	Batch loading for efficiency

-> Implemented Forward Hooks for Feature Extraction
  Added forward hooks to three key layers in ResNet-101:
  1.	layer1 – Top layer
  2.	layer3 – middle layer
  3.	avgpool – deep layer
  Stored each layer's output in a shared dictionary (features = {}) during forward passes.

-> Ran Forward Pass and Collected and Saved Feature Maps and Original Images
  For each input batch:
  1.	Passed the images through the model.
  2.	Extracted feature maps for all three layers via hooks.
  3.	Confirmed the output shapes:
      layer3 → (1024, 14, 14)
      layer1 → (256, 56, 56)
      avgpool → (2048, 1, 1)

-> Saved feature maps as .pt tensors:
  1.	/image_reconstruction_project/features/layer1/
  2.	/image_reconstruction_project/features/layer3/
  3.	/image_reconstruction_project/features/avgpool/
  Saved corresponding original images as PNGs in: /image_reconstruction_project/images/
  Implemented a save limit (save_limit = 1000) for controlled extraction.
  Successfully extracted and saved 1000 complete samples.

-> Week 2 established the entire feature extraction & dataset generation pipeline, which will now be used for: Training the GAN-based generator which will be done in Week 3
